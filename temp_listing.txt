15	## Foundations (Transformers + Attention)
16	
17	- The Illustrated Transformer — Clear visuals for attention and the encoder–decoder stack. <https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/>
18	- Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017) — The original Transformer paper; skim for architecture, read for intuition. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>
19	
20	## Prompting + Patterns
21	
22	- OpenAI Cookbook — Practical prompting patterns, evaluation ideas, and tooling. <https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook>
23	- Prompt engineering patterns (assorted guides) — Use chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and structured outputs judiciously; measure impact, don't assume.
24	
25	## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
26	
27	- Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP (Lewis et al., 2020) — The core idea and trade-offs. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401>
28	- Vector databases (docs) — Focus on indexing choices, chunking strategies, and evaluation with domain text.
29	
30	## Evaluation
31	
32	- IR metrics primer — Precision/Recall@k, MRR, nDCG; know how they respond to re-ranking and chunking.
33	- Task-specific evals — Measure faithfulness, answer correctness, and source attribution; prefer automatic + spot human audit.
34	
35	## Agents + Tool Use
36	
37	- Keep it simple first — Tool calling adds latency and failure modes; add only with clear ROI and guardrails.
38	- Monitoring + fallback — Log tool inputs/outputs, timeouts, and define safe fallbacks.
39	
40	## Systems Design
41	
42	- Start with evals — Define success metrics before scaling complexity.
43	- Observability — Capture prompts, versions, inputs, outputs, and model metadata for reproducibility.

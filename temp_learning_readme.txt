 15: - `cheatsheets/` — quick, practical references
 16: - `roadmaps/` — step-by-step pathways through topics
 17: - `papers/` — paper summaries with key takeaways
 18: - `courses/` — course notes and exercises
 19: - `glossary.md` — concise definitions

 21: ## Conventions
 22: - Every file starts with YAML front matter: `title`, `summary`, `type`, `level`, `topics`, `updated`, `see_also`.
 23: - Use lowercase-hyphenated filenames (e.g., `agents-reading-list.md`).
 24: - Keep curated lists focused; include 1–2 line commentary per link.
 25:  - For now, write `topics` as a single-line bracket list (e.g., `topics: [llms, evals]`) so the index script can parse it.

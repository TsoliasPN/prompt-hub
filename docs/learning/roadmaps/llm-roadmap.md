## Milestones

1) Foundations: Python, linear algebra, probability, basic ML.
2) Transformers: Attention mechanics, training objectives, scaling laws.
3) Prompting: Patterns, structure, evaluation.
4) Retrieval (RAG): Indexes, chunking, re-ranking, grounding.
5) Evals: Retrieval metrics + task correctness/faithfulness.
6) Agents/Tools: When and how to add tools safely.
7) MLOps: Versioning, observability, deployment.

## Suggested sequence

- Week 1–2: Read The Illustrated Transformer; skim original paper.
- Week 3: Build a tiny transformer; write prompts with a prompt cookbook.
- Week 4–5: Prototype RAG; measure retrieval + answer quality.
- Week 6: Add basic tool use; add logging and eval gates.

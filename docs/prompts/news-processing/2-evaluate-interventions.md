The following text inside brackets discusses various government interventions: [input a text here describing the government intervention(s) whose adequacy you want to evaluate]. Please analyze the effectiveness of these interventions by evaluating the following elements:

2. Expert Studies: How do the expert opinions or studies mentioned in the text reflect on the adequacy of the interventions? Are experts suggesting that these efforts are sufficient, or do they propose alternative solutions?
3. Historical Data: How does the historical context of the issue influence the assessment of the government’s interventions? Is there evidence that similar past efforts have been successful or failed, and how does that shape the current intervention's likelihood of success?

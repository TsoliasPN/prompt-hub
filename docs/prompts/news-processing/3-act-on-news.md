## Description
Turn a news story into a personalized, actionable checklist—iteratively refined via Q&A.

## Prompt
```
Here's a text: “[paste the news story here]” Based on this text, create one simple, actionable checklist; the goal is to create a checklist that is easy to follow and provide actionable steps. Keep your checklist items clear, concise, and organized in a logical order. Use Bullet Points: This makes the checklist easy to read. Focus on Actionable Items: For example, instead of “Ensure data privacy compliance,” specify, “Review data collection practices for GDPR compliance, including consent forms and data retention policies.” Group Items by Categories: Organize the checklist by stages or areas (e.g., "Data Collection," "Data Storage," "Data Sharing" for GDPR compliance). Use that checklist to help me use it for my very personal situation. If you need to ask me questions, then ask me one question at a time, so that you asking and me replying, you can end up with a simple plan for me.

If you submit this prompt and the AI only replies with a checklist, without any question, then simply reply back with the last two sentences of the prompt:

Use that checklist to help me use it for my very personal situation. If you need to ask me questions, then ask me one question at a time, so that you asking and me replying, you can end up with a simple plan for me.

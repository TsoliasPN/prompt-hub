## Description
Meta-prompts that dissect, critique, and reforge ideas via multiple perspectives and iterative questioning.

## Prompt
- Present first as a ‘Today I Learned’, then as a ‘Life Pro Tip’, each ≤ 50 words.  
- Give two answers: one rational, one uncanny-dream logic. Let them argue, then fuse their best parts.  
- Respond from 25 years in the future. Report on the long-tail consequences of this idea in brisk executive telegrams.  
- Slice my plan into exactly five strokes: intention, terrain, rhythm, void, victory. Speak only in verbs.  
- Write the high-society summary first. Below it, the same info translated into shop-floor profanity.  
- Rewrite my argument, then critique the rewrite, then critique the critique — all in 3 nested texts.  
- Unfold my vague question into a sequence of smaller, sharper questions; wait for my answer after each.  
- If this proposal failed spectacularly, write the post-mortem headline, cause, and single Jira ticket that would have prevented it.  
- Turn my problem into a tabletop micro-game: stats, win condition, random events. 1 page.  
- Give two parallel action plans: one Marcus Aurelius-stoic, one Go-with-the-Flow surfer. End with the hybrid ‘Golden Mean’ step.

## Context Reviewers / Knitters

## Description

Meta-prompts that dissect, critique, and reforge ideas via multiple perspectives and iterative questioning.

## How to Use

- Append a single prompt pattern below to your instruction.
- Keep text verbatim to preserve behavior; fill in any inputs.
- Iterate one pattern at a time for clarity.

## Prompts

```text
Present first as a "Today I Learned", then as a "Life Pro Tip", each <= 50 words.  
Give two answers: one rational, one uncanny-dream logic. Let them argue, then fuse their best parts.  
Respond from 25 years in the future. Report on the long-tail consequences of this idea in brisk executive telegrams.  
Slice my plan into exactly five strokes: intention, terrain, rhythm, void, victory. Speak only in verbs.  
Write the high-society summary first. Below it, the same info translated into shop-floor profanity.  
Rewrite my argument, then critique the rewrite, then critique the critique — all in 3 nested texts.  
Unfold my vague question into a sequence of smaller, sharper questions; wait for my answer after each.  
If this proposal failed spectacularly, write the post-mortem headline, cause, and single Jira ticket that would have prevented it.  
Turn my problem into a tabletop micro-game: stats, win condition, random events. 1 page.  
Give two parallel action plans: one Marcus Aurelius-stoic, one Go-with-the-Flow surfer. End with the hybrid "Golden Mean" step.
```

# Prompt Booster

Append-only add-on to boost output quality by prompting for clarification, adding an expert lens, and offering alternative framings.

## How to Use
- Append the snippet below to the end of any prompt.
- For quick tasks, use the minimal version. For high-stakes tasks, follow the full checklist.

## Use Cases

### 1) Clarify
Get to 95% confidence before acting by asking concrete, answerable questions that remove ambiguity.

!!! tip "When to use"
    - Requirements feel underspecified or subjective
    - There are multiple valid interpretations of the task
    - You suspect hidden constraints (scope, timeline, audience)

Example

```text
Before answering, ask up to 3 targeted questions to remove ambiguity that could change the output. Prioritize crisp, answerable questions.
```

### 2) Expert Lens
Adopt a top 0.1% practitioner's viewpoint to surface standards, pitfalls, and trade-offs.

!!! tip "When to use"
    - Decisions have quality or risk implications
    - You need best practices and common failure modes
    - You want a short, opinionated "expert take"

Example

```text
Add a brief "Top 0.1% Expert Take": cite key standards, common pitfalls, and the best-practice approach for this context.
```

### 3) Reframe
Offer 2–3 alternative framings that could change the approach, success criteria, or evaluation.

!!! tip "When to use"
    - Problem definition may be too narrow
    - You want to explore faster/safer/clearer paths
    - Stakeholders disagree on the goal

Example

```text
Provide 2–3 alternative framings of the problem and note how each framing would change the approach or acceptance criteria.
```

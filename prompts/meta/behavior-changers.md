# Behavior Changers

## Description
A collection of directives to push the assistant into different meta-behaviors and self-reflection modes.

## How to Use
- Paste one directive below at the end of your prompt.
- Use one at a time for clarity; combine only if they donâ€™t conflict.
- Keep the directive verbatim; tweak only the bracketed roles if needed.

A lone period from me means CONTINUE autonomously to the next milestone; stop only for blocking questions.

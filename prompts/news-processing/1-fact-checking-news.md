Here's some text inside brackets: [input the text here]. Task: You are tasked with fact-checking the provided text. Please follow the steps below and provide a detailed response. If you need to ask me questions, ask one question at a time, so that by you asking and me replying, you will be able to produce the most reliable fact-check of the provided text. Here are the steps you should follow:
1. Source Evaluation: Identify the primary source of the information in the text (e.g., author, speaker, publication, or website). Assess the credibility of this source based on the following:
   - Expertise: Is the source an expert or authority on the subject?
   - Past Reliability: Has the source demonstrated accuracy or consistency in past claims?
   - Potential Bias: Does the source have any noticeable biases that could affect the reliability of the information presented?
2. Cross-Referencing: Cross-reference the claims made in the text with reputable and trustworthy external sources.
   - Look for corroboration: Are other authoritative sources, publications, or experts supporting the claims made in the text?
   - Identify discrepancies: If there are any inconsistencies or contradictions between the text and trusted sources, please highlight them.
3. Rating System: Provide a rating for the overall reliability of the text, based on the information provided. Use the following categories:
   - True: The claims in the text are supported by credible sources and factual evidence.
   - Minor Errors: There are small inaccuracies or omissions that do not significantly affect the overall message.
   - Needs Double-Checking: The information provided is unclear or may be misleading. Further verification is needed for key claims.
   - False: The claims in the text are incorrect, misleading, or entirely unsupported by credible sources.
4. Contextual Analysis: Consider the broader context of the claims made in the text. Are there any nuances, qualifiers, or details that might be missing, which could affect the interpretation of the information? If there is a subtle misrepresentation or missing context, please describe the impact it has on the accuracy of the claims.
5. Timeliness Check: Assess whether the claims are based on outdated information.
   - Is the information current?: Are there recent developments or changes that have not been accounted for?
   - If the information is outdated, indicate how this affects the validity of the text’s claims.
6. Final Summary: Provide a brief summary of your fact-checking analysis:
   - Highlight any key errors or issues found in the text.
   - Suggest additional sources or strategies for the user to verify the text further, if applicable.
   - Provide your overall judgment on whether the text is reliable, needs further scrutiny, or should be dismissed as false.

LLM Prompt Booster - Append To Any Prompt
------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Improve output quality by forcing clarification, expert perspective, and reframing.

How to use
- Append the "Copy-paste snippet" to the end of any prompt.
- Keep it short when you need speed; use the checklist when stakes are high.

Checklist (full version)
1) Clarify: Ask targeted questions until you are at least 95% confident you can complete the task correctly. Prefer concrete, answerable questions.
2) Expert lens: Think like a top 0.1% expert in the field; call out standards, pitfalls, trade-offs, and the best-practice approach.
3) Reframe: Provide 2-3 alternative framings of the problem that could change the approach or success criteria.
